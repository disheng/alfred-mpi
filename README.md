Alfred MPI distributed test extension

Alfred MPI is a project dependant on Alfred that permits the distribution of the training phase on multiple processes accross a cluster (or a single machine) using MPJ.

It also contains a way to perform the testing of the output of the training phases through a MapReduce job (compatible with Amazon Elastic MapReduce)

The source tree contains a pom.xml that permits to produce the relevant jars for the two different phases.

Documentation (italian language) about prerequites can be found at: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/furio/alfred-mpi/blob/master/DocumentazioneSistemiscaCluster.html
